What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?\r\n2. Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript\r\n3. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?\r\n4. How do you check if an array is empty?\r\n5. What is a closure?\r\n\r\nIntermediate Level:\r\n1. Explain the `this` keyword in JavaScript\r\n2. What are promises? How do they work?\r\n3. Difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`\r\n4. How does event bubbling work?\r\n5. Explain prototypal inheritance\r\n\r\nAdvanced Level:\r\n1. Implement a debounce function\r\n2. Create a deep clone function\r\n3. Explain event loop and asynchronous JavaScript\r\n4. How would you implement memoization?\r\n5. Implement a custom promise\r\n\r\nCode Challenge Questions:\r\n1. Flatten a nested array\r\n```javascript\r\n// Flatten [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\r\nfunction flattenArray(arr) {\r\n  return arr.reduce((flat, toFlatten) => {\r\n    return flat.concat(Array.isArray(toFlatten) ? flattenArray(toFlatten) : toFlatten);\r\n  }, []);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Implement a function to check if a number is prime\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction isPrime(num) {\r\n  if (num <= 1) return false;\r\n  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {\r\n    if (num % i === 0) return false;\r\n  }\r\n  return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTricky Questions:\r\n1. What will be the output?\r\n```javascript\r\nconsole.log(1 + \"2\" + \"2\");  // \"122\"\r\nconsole.log(1 + +\"2\" + \"2\"); // \"32\"\r\nconsole.log(1 + -\"1\" + \"2\"); // \"02\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Scope and Closure:\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\r\n  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);\r\n}\r\n// Outputs: 3, 3, 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance and Optimization:\r\n1.

Implement a function to chunk an array\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction chunkArray(arr, size) {\r\n  return arr.reduce((chunks, el, i) => {\r\n    if (i % size === 0) {\r\n      chunks.push([el]);\r\n    } else {\r\n      chunks[chunks.length - 1].push(el);\r\n    }\r\n    return chunks;\r\n  }, []);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBonus Complex Question:\r\n1. Implement a custom promise with `.then()` and `.catch()`\r\n```javascript\r\nclass MyPromise {\r\n  constructor(executor) {\r\n    this.state = 'pending';\r\n    this.value = undefined;\r\n    this.onResolveCallbacks = [];\r\n    this.onRejectCallbacks = [];\r\n\r\n    const resolve = (value) => {\r\n      if (this.state === 'pending') {\r\n        this.state = 'fulfilled';\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n        this.onResolveCallbacks.forEach(fn => fn(value));\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    const reject = (reason) => {\r\n      if (this.state === 'pending') {\r\n        this.state = 'rejected';\r\n        this.value = reason;\r\n        this.onRejectCallbacks.forEach(fn => fn(reason));\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      executor(resolve, reject);\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      reject(error);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {\r\n    // Implementation of then method\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  catch(onRejected) {\r\n    // Implementation of catch method\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTips for Interview Preparation:\r\n- Understand core JavaScript concepts\r\n- Practice coding challenges\r\n- Learn design patterns\r\n- Understand async programming\r\n- Know how to optimize code\r\n- Be prepared to explain your thought process\r\n\r\nRemember, interviews are not just about knowing the right answer, but demonstrating problem-solving skills and understanding of core concepts.\r\n\r\n\r\nsome questions:\r\n1. why do we need react?\r\n2. why vite is faster than CRA?\r\n3.what is React component?\r\n4.what is react element ?\r\n5.what is state in react?\r\n6.contextAPI VS REDUX\r\n7.what is babel?(resource map)\r\n8.why we need react fragments?\r\n9.Factory fn ?\r\n10.expalin prototype in array?\r\n11. how to create constructor fn?\r\n12.",
